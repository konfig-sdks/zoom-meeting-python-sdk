For instance, if you would like the webinar to recur on 23rd of each month, provide `23` as the value of this field and `1` as the value of the `repeat_interval` field. Instead, if you would like the webinar to recur once every three months, on 23rd of the month, change the value of the `repeat_interval` field to `3`.

    # Use this field **only if you're scheduling a recurring webinar of type** `3` to state the week of the month when the webinar should recur. If you use this field, **you must also use the `monthly_week_day` field to state the day of the week when the webinar should recur.**     `-1` - Last week of the month.    `1` - First week of the month.    `2` - Second week of the month.    `3` - Third week of the month.    `4` - Fourth week of the month.
    monthly_week: int

    # Use this field **only if you're scheduling a recurring webinar of type** `3` to state a specific day in a week when the monthly webinar should recur.

    # Define the interval when the webinar should recur. For instance, if you would like to schedule a Webinar that recurs every two months, you must set the value of this field as `2` and the value of the `type` parameter as `3`.   For a daily webinar, the maximum interval you can set is `90` days. For a weekly webinar, the maximum interval that you can set is `12` weeks. For a monthly webinar, the maximum interval that you can set is `3` months.
    repeat_interval: int

    # Use this field **only if you're scheduling a recurring webinar of type** `2` to state which day(s) of the week the webinar should repeat.

For instance, if the webinar should recur on Sunday, provide `1` as the value of this field.           **Note:** If you would like the webinar to occur on multiple days of a week, you should provide comma separated values for this field. For instance, if the webinar should recur on Sundays and Tuesdays, provide `1,3` as the value of this field.      `1`  - Sunday.     `2` - Monday.    `3` - Tuesday.    `4` -  Wednesday.    `5` -  Thursday.    `6` - Friday.    `7` - Saturday.
